-- Although TRUNCATE TABLE is similar to DELETE , 
-- it is classified as a DDL statement rather than a DML statement. 
-- It differs from DELETE in the following ways: 
-- Truncate operations drop and re-create the table, 
-- which is much faster than deleting rows one by one, 
-- particularly for large tables.
